	  Elixir programming language and tooling (runs on the Erlang VM).

	  NOTE: GRiSP ALLoy does not deploy Elixir binaries to the target by
	  default. This package is primarily used to produce Elixir tooling
	  in the SDK (host-elixir) and to stage Elixir stdlib when needed
	  for release assembly. Target install step is intentionally empty
	  unless explicitly enabled.
