# project.sh - Project plugin entry point and contract
#
# This module loads all project-type plugins and provides:
#  1) project_setup      → loads plugins and registers supported types
#  2) project_detect     → auto-detects a project's type
#  3) project_build      → dispatches build to the detected type's handler
#
# Plugin loading
#  - Plugins live under plugins/project/*.sh
#  - project_setup sources all *.sh files and collects their type names from
#    the filename (without .sh) into PROJECT_TYPES.
#
# Auto-detection
#  - project_detect iterates PROJECT_TYPES and calls project_detect_<type>
#    with the project directory.
#  - The first detector that returns success (exit code 0) is selected and the
#    type name is returned via the provided reference variable.
#
# Build dispatch
#  - project_build internally calls project_detect, then invokes
#    project_build_<type> with the same arguments.
#
# Plugin contract (for a plugin file plugins/project/<type>.sh)
#  - project_detect_<type> project_dir
#      Return 0 if project_dir matches <type>; return non-zero otherwise.
#  - project_build_<type> resref project_dir profile target_erlang
#      Build the project release and set resref to the absolute path of the
#      assembled release directory. Return non-zero on failure.
#
# Notes
#  - Detectors should only check for their own type; they must not modify
#    global state or source other plugins.
#  - Keep detection order-independent where possible; if multiple types match,
#    the first one found wins according to filesystem order.
